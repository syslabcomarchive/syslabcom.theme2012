# ENISA

Portal and Performance Services for the European Network and Information Security Agency.

# Background

ENISA - the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security - works for the EU Institutions and Member States. It represents the EU’s response to cyber security issues of the European Union. As such, it is the 'pace-setter' for Information Security in Europe and a centre of expertise. The objective is to make ENISA’s web site the European ‘hub’ for exchange of information, best practices and knowledge in the field of Information Security. This web site is an access point to the EU Member States and other actors in this field.
