Use a *Workspace* to collaborate with others on a particular project.
Here you can collect and create the material you need, together with your team.

#### Discuss


Get involved by commenting, sharing and liking, just like on your favourite social media websites.
Let your thoughts flow creatively.
You never know where the next big idea is going to come from!

Show what can be done and collect the results. Share access to internal and external resources wider and faster. Get immediate feedback to improve and decide.

#### Case management

Some projects are more complicated and need different groups of people to get involved at particular stages.
We use the metaphor of a train journey to make this intuitive.
Check the status of the project at a glance, and help it to reach the next milestone on the way to completion.
