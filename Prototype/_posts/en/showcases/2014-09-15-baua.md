# Solution

Together with BAuA we developed the Online Portal for Risk Assessment in Germany. It serves as central portal for all needs on Risk Assessment providing introductory information, expert knowledge, service and concrete good practice examples and practical aids.

The aids are stored in a multilingual database which can be maintained by the social partners independently. An interface to an event database allows direct access to relevant training.
