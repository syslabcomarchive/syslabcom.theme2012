## Star Alliance

Star GmbH is a dedicated, carrier-owned brand and project management organization based in Frankfurt, Germany. The organization works closely with member carriers in product development and maintenance and also coordinates cost-down initiatives on behalf of the member airlines. Star GmbH also develops and delivers initiatives designed to improve efficiency and reduce carrier costs.

## Background

Their previous solution (Webwork) was a web based collaboration platform used by Star Alliance employees for document storage and retrieval as well as online collaboration. It was also accessed by employees of the Star Alliance member carriers. It contains reference information about the carriers as well as guidelines, press releases, process descriptions, contact data and other information.

## Requirements

Star GmbH was looking for a new portal, collaboration and document management solution to improve information dissemination and team cooperation across the employee network of its member airlines.

## Solution

SYSLAB.COM was commissioned with the project and developed a publicly available web front page, which displays news and reference information. The new portal system provides a seamless access to a wide variety of Star Alliance applications. Performance, navigation, usability and search functions have been vastly improved compared with that provided by the old system. A migration path for content to the new system has been established, which places minimal effort on users. SYSLAB develops ongoing changes to the existing applications of the portal system.
