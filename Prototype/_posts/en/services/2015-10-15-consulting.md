#### Implementation

Besides technical development and doing end-to-end projects, we also offers consultancy services. If your company already has a web team, who handles your internal requirements, we can provide services in developing strategy, choosing appropriate technologies, procurement and configuration, right through to project management and integration.

#### Assessment

Our assessment services are designed to provide customers with preliminary consulting services on their existing technical infrastructure with regards to their business processes and goals.

The next level would be to make recommendations on integration of Open Source solutions into the existing framework. This initial assessment allows the parties involved to get a clear insight on requirements and solutions respectively, which clearly is the foundation for a successful implementation of the given solution.

#### Zope and Plone consultancy

#### Design and usability

Are you having problems with an outdated website design or an application that does not work fully to your satisfaction? Then we can help. Our web designers and strategic consultants are flexible and work independently or in tandem with our technical experts. We offer dedicated solutions, unique to each company´s business practices and processes. Where a full design and build project is not appropriate, we provide simple but effective solutions to achieve your objectives.
