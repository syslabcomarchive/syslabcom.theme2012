#### Open source

Open Source is a central topic in the IT business today. We build Open Source Software, because we believe in the concept. With Open Source Software (OSS) the source code as opposed to proprietary software is made available and can be changed. An open (and therefore normally larger) group of developers work on the software. Improvements are constantly published in the newest (developer) version. Because of the licence model there is no revenue from royalties. Business models mainly base on consulting services, implementation, integration and maintenance.

- Security: As the sources are open, bugs can be fixed early.
- Independence: With open source software there is no vendor lock in.
- Extensibility: There are no limits to extend the software to custom needs.
- Cusomisation: The software solutions are specifically adjusted to the companies that use them.


#### Custom solutions based on standard software

The open source ecosystem covers a broad field of application. Many of the available software solutions have been around for a long time and can be considered rock solid. Based on that foundation, we can effectively model organisational business processes and create tools that effectively solve the challenges unique to your company.

#### Stable and future proof

We implement solutions closely following the core Plone and Plone Intranet style guides. This is necessary to assure that solutions can be easily upgraded and don't conflict with security hotfixes. We are happy to also provide service levels to maintain all custom development - just specify your needs, we will cover them.
