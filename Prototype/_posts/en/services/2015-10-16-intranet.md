#### Few people really love their intranet

Nearly every company already has an intranet, but few people actually enjoy using it.
Often it was introduced as a static system to solve the need to share information.
But then it is expected to function also as a productivity and collaboration tool.
It grows organically and runs into problems coping with new requirements that were beyond the original design.
Over time many an intranet has become a storage yard for obsolete documents, as everything is kept and nothing is retired.
It can become frustrating to find the content you need and also to add new content which others can find.


#### Intranets are complex systems

An intranet models the inner workings of an organisation.
It is a dynamic environment, which changes and adapts to external forces along with the organisation.
A good intranet is flexible enough to do that.


#### What makes a great intranet?

A great intranet puts the needs of the people who use it above all else.
Gathering business requirements from the employees before any technology planning is critical to success.
The difference between home and work is blurring as more "digital natives" enter the workforce.
A modern intranet must support social media tools and digital communication.
Outdated information results in people using incorrect data and ultimately losing faith in the system.
An intranet should be the best place to find the information you need, and to share the information you have with others.
You should know that the most relevant, current and accurate information is at your fingertips.


#### Intranets are powerful

We care about making great intranets because we know how powerful they can be.
The hub of your organisation, where ideas and connections are cultivated and barriers to getting your job done are taken out of the picture.
This is what we strive to create.
